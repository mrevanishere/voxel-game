# voxel-engine
creating something like Minecraft to get used to C++/OpenGL

## Purpose
Objectives

* ~Learn the basics of OpenGL~

* Learn associated algorithms

  * Culling algorithm for reducing vertices
  
  * Greedy meshing algorithm for reducing vertices

  * Ray algorithm for target hitbox
  
  * Perlin noise for world generation

* Learn advanced shading / shader techniques

## Tech
Built with
* C++ / MinGW / CMake
* OpenGL
* GLAD, GLFW3, GLM, stb

## Warning
The include for GLFW is either <glfw.h> or <GLFW/glfw.h>
